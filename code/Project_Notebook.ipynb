    "# Topic Modeling to Identify Women's Health Concerns on Online Forums\n",
    "#### Author: Jocelyn Lutes\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Project Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Citizen science is an emerging field of research in which members of the public volunteer to participate in scientific research [(1)](https://www.citizenscience.gov/about/#). One of the most well-known, crowd-sourced citizen science is projects is [American Gut](https://msystems.asm.org/content/3/3/e00031-18), a citizen science project designed to better understand the human microbiome. For this project, citizens interested in contributing to the project paid $99 to receive a sample collection kit and were given instructions to submit the sample [(2)](https://anesthesiology.duke.edu/?p=846744). Within approximately five years, it was estimated that American Gut received samples from over 11,000 people in 45 different countries [(2)](https://anesthesiology.duke.edu/?p=846744), illustrating the willingness of individualas to participate in research and the power of citizen science for generating large datasets that can answer important research questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The field of developmental neurotoxicology is interested in understanding the developmental origins of the nervous system throughout the lifespan [(3)](https://www.dntshome.org). Within this field, a substantial amount of research is dedicated to understanding how events that occur during a woman's pregnancy (e.g. illness, treatment with medication, psychological distress, etc.) impact the development of the baby's brain and behavior. Traditional research within the field of maternal health and infant development has relied on maternal report of any events that occurred during pregnancy through regularly-scheduled interviews with a trained research assistant or counselor. Although these interviews provide important information for the studies, the accuracy of reporting depends on the ability of the expecting mother to recall any important events that happened during her pregnancy. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to eliminate any gaps in reporting and to gain a more-representative picture of a woman's pregnancy, we would like to to plan a citizen science project in which women who are interested in participating can download a mobile application that would allow them to log important events during their pregnancy in real time. However, understanding that this will be a large time commitment for participating women, we would also like to provide them with specially curated resources related to women's health concerns. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to ensure that any resources that are provided in the application are relevant to potential users, the project leads have proposed that we use an open-ended survey or multiple focus groups to identify several women's health concerns. However, surveys and focus groups can be costly in terms of both time and money, and the project is operating on a limited budget and needs to be completed as quickly as possible. Additionally, it is possible that the small number of women who would be invited to join a focus group or to receive a survey would not be representative of the larger population of women who could opt to particpate in the research. Therefore, the data science team was tasked to uncover an alternate way to identify women's health concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, **I will use natural language processing and unsupervised techniques, such as clustering and topic modeling, to identify women's health concerns from posts in online forums.** Specific concerns will be identified for general women's health, fertility and pregnancy, and postpartum/early parenthood.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "### Data Collection\n",
    "Data was collected on August 7, 2020 using the [Pushshift Reddit API](https://github.com/pushshift/api). This API allows for easy aggregation of posts from Reddit.com. For each health domain, data was collected that spanned from August 7, 2020 to February 16, 2019 (a period of approximately 17.5 months).    \n",
    "\n",
    "**1. General Women's Health Data:**  \n",
    "* Posts relating to general women's health concerns were collected from [r/WomensHealth](https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/), [r/obgyn](https://www.reddit.com/r/obgyn/), and [r/thegirlsurvivalguide](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/). \n",
    "* This resulted in a total of 31,385 posts from 19,753 unique users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Fertility and Pregnancy Data:**  \n",
    "* Posts relating to fertility and pregnancy were collected from [r/TryingForABaby](https://www.reddit.com/r/TryingForABaby/), [r/pregnant](https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/), and [r/BabyBumps]https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/). \n",
    "* This resulted in a total of 98,138 posts from 35,127 unique users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Postpartum and Early Parenthood Data:**\n",
    "* Posts relating to the postpartum period and early parenthood were collected from [r/beyondthebump](https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/), [r/postpartumdepression](https://www.reddit.com/r/postpartumdepression/), and [r/breastfeeding](https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/).\n",
    "* This resulted in a total of 51,674 posts from 21,585 unique users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing\n",
    "Once data was in hand, all data was cleaned to check for missing values and inappropriate data types. HTML tags, Reddit-specific tags (e.g. \"[removed]\", \"[deleted]\"), URLs, and digits were removed from the text. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data was cleaned, a custom list of stop words was defined, and posts were lemmatized using ***spaCy***. (Lemmatization refers to the process of reducing a word to its base root.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to modeling, a document term matrix was created using the tf-idf vectorizer by ***sklearn***. (Tf-idf creates a bag of words with a weight for each word that is based upon the number of times a word appears in a post and the number of posts that it appears in. If a word appears in many documents, it will receive a low ranking.) If a ***gensim*** model was used, the document term matrix was further processed to create a ***gensim*** corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Topic Modeling\n",
    "NOT YET COMPLETED - I will update this once I have finalized the models. I think that I will most likely have KMeans Clustering and LDA. I might also try Hierarchical Clustering and NNMF.\n",
